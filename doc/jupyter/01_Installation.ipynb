    "We can now test the installation by running our first experiment: Testing a simplified AEB system avoiding a collision with a pedestrian. (Note: Only linear motion planning, no comprehensive vehicles dynamics or environmental simulation is used. This system is just for testing the installation of OpenSBT.)\n",
