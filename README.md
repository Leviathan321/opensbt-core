## About

OpenSBT is a modular and extensible codebase designed to facilitate search-based testing of automated driving systems, whether for research, in education or in an industrial context. It provides well-defined interfaces for the integration of search algorithms, fitness functions, testing oracles, and simulation environments in a modular and flexible manner. In addition, OpenSBT supports the visualization of testing results and analysis of the failing behaviour of automated driving systems. 

## Overview

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/opensbt/opensbt-core/blob/main/docs/figures/OpenSBT_architecture_120124.png?raw=True" width=500 ></div>

OpenSBT builds upon [Pymoo](https://pymoo.org/) 0.6.0.1 and extends internal optimization related models to tailor heuristic search algorithms for testing automated driving systems. An introductory video of OpenSBT can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_CTTzrk5s. 

## Installation

OpenSBT requires Python to be installed and its compatibility has been tested with Python 3.8. OpenSBT can be run as a standalone application or can be imported as a library.

You can install OpenSBT via pypi:

```bash
pip install opensbt
```

If using as a standalone appplication install the dependencies after downloading OpenSBT files:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A complete installation example is available as a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/opensbt/opensbt-core/tree/main/docs/jupyter/01_Installation.ipynb).

## Getting Started

In the core implementation of OpenSBT a simplified dummy simulator is integrated (linear motion planning, no GPU required). To run an example test generation for this example run (flag -e holds the experiment number):

```bash
python run.py -e 5
```

Several result artefacts are generated after the generation has finished. All artefacts are written into the *results* folder in a folder named DummySimulator (problem name). 

You can find several tutorials as [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/opensbt/opensbt-core/tree/main/docs/jupyter) which explain step-by-step of how integrate custom simulators and define testing components and objectives in OpenSBT.

The tutorials include as an example the integration of a real-world FMI-based AEB agent developed in the [fortiss Mobility lab](https://www.fortiss.org/forschung/fortiss-labs/detail/mobility-lab) simulated in [CARLA](https://carla.org/) using the simulator adapter [CARLA Runner Extension](https://github.com/opensbt/carla-runner).

As another example we have integrated Simulink-based systems simulated in Prescan [simulator adapter](https://github.com/opensbt/prescan_runner) into OpenSBT.


## Output

OpenSBT produces several result artefacts. An excerpt is given below.
