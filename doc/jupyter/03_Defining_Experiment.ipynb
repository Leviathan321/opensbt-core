    "### Usage Example\n",
    "We describe the usage of the framework by testing the BehaviourAgent (AEB) in the CARLA Simulator for collisions and close to collision situations. The example has been implemented on Ubuntu.\n",
    "\n",
    "As testing scenario we consider a pedestrian that is crossing the lane of the ego vehicle. The scenario is provided as an OpenSCENARIO 1.2 [file](scenarios/PedestrianCrossing.xosc). We vary the speed of ego, the speed of pedestrian, and the distance to the ego vehicle when the pedestrian starts walking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Integrating the Simulator/SUT\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate a simulator we need to implement the [simulate]() method of the [`Simulator`]() class. In this method a scenario instance is passed to the simulator to execute the SUT in the scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of *simulate* is simulator specific. For CARLA we have implemented a [module](https://git.fortiss.org/fortissimo/ff1_testing/ff1_carla), that needs to be called from the simulate method. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Implementing a fitness function\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a new fitness function we need to implement the `Fitness` class (interface). We implement the eval function in the class, which receives as input a [`SimulationOutput`](https://git.fortiss.org/opensbt/opensbt-core/-/blob/main/simulation/simulator.py#L40-62) and returns a scalar or vector-valued output.\n",
    "In our example we have a vector valued output, since as the first objective we want to minimize the distance to the pedestrian, and as the second objective we want to maximize the velocity of the ego vehicle. Additionally, we assign inside the class a name to each objective and declare whether the value is maximized or minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FitnessMinDistanceVelocity(Fitness):\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def min_or_max(self):\n",
    "        return \"min\", \"max\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def name(self):\n",
    "        return \"Min distance\", \"Velocity at min distance\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def eval(self, simout: SimulationOutput) -> Tuple[float]:\n",
    "        traceEgo = simout.location[\"ego\"]                     # the ego vehicle has the name \"ego\"   \n",
    "        tracePed = simout.location[\"adversary\"]               # the vulnerable actor has the name adversary \n",
    "\n",
    "        ind_min_dist = np.argmin(geometric.distPair(traceEgo, tracePed))\n",
    "\n",
    "        # distance between ego and other object\n",
    "        distance = np.min(geometric.distPair(traceEgo, tracePed))\n",
    "\n",
    "        # speed of ego at time of the minimal distance\n",
    "        speed = simout.speed[\"ego\"][ind_min_dist]\n",
    "\n",
    "        return (distance, speed)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Further we implement a [criticality function](evaluation/critical.py) by implementing the interface class `Critical` to indicate when a scenario is considered fault-revealing/critical. The corresponding *eval* function receives as input the fitness value(s) and the simulation output to declare based on this whether a scenario is critical: (here: when 1) a collision ocurred, 2) min distance < 0.5m or 3) ego velocity > 0 (inverted sign)). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
