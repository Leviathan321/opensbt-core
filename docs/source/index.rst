About
==================
OpenSBT is a modular and extensible codebase designed to facilitate search-based testing of 
automated driving systems, whether for research, in education or in an industrial context. 
An introductory video of OpenSBT can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_CTTzrk5s.
 

Getting Started
===============

This section will help you get started with installing and running **OpenSBT**.


Installation
+++++++++++++++

OpenSBT requires Python to be installed and its compatibility has been tested with Python 3.8. OpenSBT can be run as a standalone application or can be imported as a library.

A. Install the project as a dependency via pip:

.. code:: console

    $ pip install opensbt

    
B. Install the project as a standalone application:

First clone the project:

.. code:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/opensbt/opensbt-core.git

Than install the dependencies:

.. code:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

A complete installation example is available as a `jupyter notebook <https://github.com/Leviathan321/leviathan321.github.io/blob/34-docs/docs/jupyter/01_Installation.ipynb>`_.  

Example
+++++++++++++++

In the core implementation of OpenSBT a simplified dummy simulator is integrated (linear motion planning, no GPU required). 

A testing problem for the dummy simulator can be e.g., defined and executed as follows:

.. code:: python

   # imports not shown
   problem = ADASProblem(
                        problem_name="DummySimulatorProblem",
                        scenario_path="scenarios/dummy_scenario.xosc",
                        simulation_variables=[
                           "orientation_ego",
                           "velocity_ego",
                           "orientation_ped",
                           "velocity_ped"],
                        xl=[0, 1, 0, 0.2],
                        xu=[180, 10,180, 3],
                        fitness_function=FitnessMinDistanceVelocity(),
                        critical_function=CriticalAdasDistanceVelocity(),
                        simulate_function=DummySimulator.simulate,
                        simulation_time=10,
                        sampling_time=0.25
                        )

   # Set search configuration
   config = DefaultSearchConfiguration()
   config.n_generations = 50
   config.population_size = 20

   # Instantiate search algorithm
   optimizer = NsgaIIOptimizer(
                              problem=problem,
                              config= config)

   # Run search
   res = optimizer.run()

   # Write results
   res.write_results(params = optimizer.parameters)

The experiment can be registed in OpenSBT via:

.. code:: python

   # imports not shown
   experiment = Experiment(name="5",
                           problem=problem,
                           algorithm=AlgorithmType.NSGAII,
                           search_configuration=DefaultSearchConfiguration())

   experiments_store.register(experiment)

To run an example test generation for this example run (flag -e holds the experiment number):

.. code:: console

   $ python run.py -e 5

Several result artefacts are generated after the generation has finished. All artefacts are written into the results folder in a folder named DummySimulator (problem name).

You can find also several other tutorials as jupyter notebooks which explain step-by-step of how integrate custom simulators and define testing components and objectives in OpenSBT.

The tutorials include as an example the integration of a real-world FMI-based AEB agent developed in the fortiss Mobility lab simulated in CARLA using the simulator adapter CARLA Runner Extension.

As another `example <https://git.fortiss.org/opensbt/prescan_runner>`_ we have integrated Simulink-based systems simulated in the Prescan simulator into OpenSBT.


Tutorials
===============

You can find several tutorials that help you to apply OpenSBT for your testing tasks.

- `Esmini Testing Example (DeepTest '23) <https://git.fortiss.org/public-ast/opensbt-deeptest-tutorial>`_ - This tutorial explains how to model the testing problem as a search-based testing problem and integrate the esmini simulator to perform testing of an automated lanekeeping system.

- `Getting Started Tutorials <https://git.fortiss.org/opensbt/opensbt-core/-/tree/main/docs/jupyter?ref_type=heads>`_  - These tutorials explain the installation of OpenSBT, the execution of test runs, and the integration of a simulator into OpenSBT.

Architecture 
===============

OpenSBT builds upon Pymoo 0.6.0.1 and extends pymoos optimization related models to tailor heuristic search algorithms for testing automated driving systems.
An overview of the architecture is shown below:
