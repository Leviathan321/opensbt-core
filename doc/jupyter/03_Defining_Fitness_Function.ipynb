    "In this tutorial we show how to specify two fitness functions for the AEB case study: \n",
    "\n",
    "- F1) This function evaluates the distance between the ego vehicle and the pedestrian.\n",
    "- F2) This function outputs the velocity of the ego vehicle at the time of the minimal distance to the pedestrian.\n",
    "\n",
    "By minimizing F1) and maximizing F2) we want to identify failure-revealing test cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSBT provdes the interface `Fitness` to implement fitness functions. `Fitness` provides the `eval` function which needs to be implemented with concrete evaluation instructions. The `eval`function receives as input an instance of  [`SimulationOutput`](https://git.fortiss.org/opensbt/opensbt-core/-/blob/main/simulation/simulator.py#L40-62) and returns a scalar or a vector valued output. \n",
    "\n",
    "A scalar value is returned when a single objective is to be optimized, otherwise a vector valued output is returned, such as in our example. Further `Fitness` contains the `min_max` function which has to return a tuple of `min` or `max` strings indicating whether the corresponding objective function is minimized or maximized. \n",
    "In the `name` function we provide names for both fitness functions to be shown in output artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the examplary fitness function in OpenSBT then looks as follows:\n",
